Tab Commander Requirements Document
Overview
Purpose
The purpose of the Tab Commander tool is to provide a command-line interface integrated within a web browser for efficient bookmark and tab management. The tool allows users to add, open, and list bookmarks using simple command-line commands.

Scope
Tab Commander will be developed as a Chrome extension with a persistent command-line interface that can be accessed from any web page or tab within the browser.

Functional Requirements
Command Line Interface (CLI)
Command Parsing:
The tool should accept user commands through a command-line interface.
The tool should parse commands and arguments correctly.
Commands
Open Command:

tab-commander open [bookmark-alias]: Opens the address that the bookmark alias points to in a new tab.
tab-commander open -r [bookmark-alias]: Opens the address in the current active tab.
Add Command:

tab-commander add [bookmark-alias]: Creates a new bookmark for the current active tab and assigns the given alias.
List Command:

tab-commander list: Lists all bookmark-alias to bookmark address mappings.
Bookmark Management
Storage:

The tool should store bookmark mappings in non-volatile memory.
The storage should persist across browser sessions.
Retrieval:

The tool should retrieve bookmark addresses using aliases.
User Interface
Popup Interface:
The tool should provide a popup interface for entering and executing commands.
The popup should display command output and errors.
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance
Speed:
Commands should be executed with minimal latency.
The tool should not noticeably impact browser performance.
Usability
Ease of Use:
The CLI should be intuitive and easy to use for users familiar with command-line tools.
Commands should provide clear feedback and error messages.
Compatibility
